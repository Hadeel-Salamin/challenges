- [ ] **What does the Status Code of an HTTP response tell us?**

When a web page is requested from a website, the website’s server responds with an HTTP status code. This code is 
an acknowledgment of the client’s request and indicates the type of response the server is sending to the client.


Status codes let us know whether the request was a success, a failure, or something in between.

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. 

The Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer result code of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request.

HTTP status codes are standard response codes given by web site servers on the internet. The codes help identify the cause 
of the problem when a web page or other resource does not load properly.
